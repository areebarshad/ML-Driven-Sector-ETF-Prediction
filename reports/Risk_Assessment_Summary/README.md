# Risk Assessment Summary 

## Overview

- The **Risk Assessment Summary** provides an in-depth analysis of various S&P 500 sectors' risk profiles based on
historical price and volatility data. 
- This assessment aims to evaluate the sectors' performance using key risk metrics such as **Sharpe Ratio**, **Annual Volatility**,
and **Annual Return**.

## Purpose

- By assessing these factors, the summary helps investors understand each sector's risk-adjusted returns, volatility, 
and potential for recovery during market downturn. 
- This report includes sector-level risk assessments, visualizations, and sector comparison for making informed investment
decisions.

## Risk Metrics Explained 

The following risk metrics are calculated and analyzed for each sector:
1. **Sharpe Ratio**: Measured the risk-adjusted return of a sector. A higher ratio indicates a better risk-return trade-off.
2. **Annual Volatility**: Represents the annualized standard deviation of returns, providing an estimate of market fluctuations.
3. **Annual Return**: Measures the yearly return of each sector, helping to evaluate overall growth potential.
